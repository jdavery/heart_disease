# Unsupervised Learning using Heart Disease Data

##  Problem Definition
This is a project to use Kaggle's K-Means Clustering for Heart Disease Analysis to do exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building and training, and comparison with unsupervised learning. 
In this case, the problem we will be exploring is **k-means clustering**. 

Information about the competition can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/k-means-clustering-for-heart-disease-analysis/overview.
The goal will be to identify clusters of patients that have similar attributes in order to facilitate targeted treatment strategies for heart disease.

### Dataset Information
The data is from the Kaggle competition. It has anonymized patient data for people that have received a diagnosis of heart disease. The data includes things like patient ID, age, sex, origin of the dataset, chest pain type, and other medicial information. The total number of columns is 15.
